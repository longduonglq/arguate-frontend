# What is Arguate
Arguate is a free chat service that allows you to chat with people who disagrees with you on any topics. The goal of Arguate is for everyone to have a chance to express and broaden their perspective of emotive topics. We believe that constructive and respectful debates on controversial topics are the most efficient way towards social progress. 

# Technology
This is the front end of Arguate.com. The UI were mostly developed with React and MaterialUI. We also used Redux for state management.
